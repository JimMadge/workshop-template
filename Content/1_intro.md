# Introduction

This is the *Jupyter Book 2 Headstart Template* to quickly and easily produce your own online interactive textbook as well as a high quality pdf enabled with Typst using the [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) technology.

This template:
- provides a ready-to-use Jupyter Book 2 structure
- is pre-configured to produce a high quality pdf using Typst
- includes a number of lessons to get you started
- includes a GitHub Action to automatically build and deploy your book online and as a pdf


Hence, the template allows you to engage with JB2 without installing any software on your own computer. You only need a web browser and a GitHub account (we provide details on how to work locally on your own computer). 

```{note}
The template and its content are not meant as a replacement of the documentation already available on the [Jupyter Book 2 website](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and the [MyST website](https://mystmd.org/guide). 
```

```{warning} Enjoy!
Once you start building JB2 books, it is likely you will get hooked!
